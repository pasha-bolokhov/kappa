     EXPERIMENTAL LIMITS ON KAPPA-MINKOWSKI FIELD THEORIES


                       ABSTRACT

    In the last decade the interest to Non-commutative field theories 
has significantly increased. In part the motivation is caused by the
conjectures that the low-energy limit of Quantum Gravity can 
be viewed as the so-called kappa-Minkowski spacetime. The non-commutative 
kappa-Minkowski field theory operates on a spacetime which possesses 
a modified Lorentz invariance. 

(1) [While in a free field theory, such a modified symmetry
might not lead to observable effects, in an interacting theory
it undoubtfully leads to deflections from customary Lorentz invariance.
Based on the fact that our world clearly exhibits interactions,]

(2) [Despite naive thinking, low energy experiment is highly sensitive to
such modifications, and thus to the scale of Non-commutativity.]

we study the kappa-corrections to interacting Quantum Electrodynamics, and
show that higher-dimensional operators induce a coupling of 
nuclear spin to an external background at low energies. Strong limits on this type of 
interactions push the scale of non-commutativity to more than 
10^7 Planck masses, thus exhibiting a severe naturalness problem 
for phenomenology of kappa-Minkowski Field Theory and its progenitors.
